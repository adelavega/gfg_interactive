        <h2>Your results!</h2>

        <p>

        On Average you saved <strong> {{'%0.0f'| format(score|float)}} </strong> Tokens when you cashed in. Thanks for the hard work!

        {%- if percentile is not none-%}
        <br>
        You performed better on this test than {{'%0.2f'| format(percentile|float)}}% of other Genes for Good participants your age. As more people take this test your ranking may change, so feel free to look at your results again.

        We cannot tell you how your score compared to others yet, as not enough people in your age bracket have completed the test. Please try again later.

        <h2>What do my results mean?</h2>

        <p>
        With this task we measure how much risk individuals are willing to take in the face of uncertainty. The number of times that you were willing to pump the balloon is a strong indicator of your general
        tolerance for risk. Your score is calculated only from balloons in which you chose to cash in your earnings, because popped balloons are not a representation of how many times you were willing to
        pump the balloon. </p>


        <h2>Why do we study risk with this task?</h2>
        This task has previously been shown to strongly relate to risky behaviors in the real world. With this task we are able to identify both individuals who are especially risky as well as individuals
        who are especially sensitive to risk. Understanding how individuals engage in risky behaviors is critical for improving methods to help populations of individuals who make too many or too few
        risky decisions in their life.
