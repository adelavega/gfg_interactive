        <p>
        On average, you were <strong> {{ score }} milliseconds </strong> slower to respond when you had to switch between categorizing words according to two rules (living/non-living and bigger/small than a soccer ball) compared to when you had to categorize the words according to only one rule.  

        This means that when you were forced to "switch" back and forth between the living/non-living and larger/smaller rules, your responses slowed down by 29 milliseconds. That's a measure of how much harder it was for you to switch between the rules, compared to when we asked you to categorize only according to a single rule.

        {%- if percentile is not none-%}
        <br>
        Your switch cost was greater than <strong> {{'%0.0f'| format(percentile|float)}}% </strong> of other Genes for Good participants your age. As more people take this test your ranking may change, so feel free to look at your results again.

        We cannot tell you how your score compared to others yet, as not enough people in your age bracket have completed the test. Please try again later.

        <h2>What do my results mean?</h2>

        <p>
        When asked to switch between two distinct tasks, people take longer to respond than when they are able to focus on a single task entirely. This "switch cost" is thought to reflect the fact that your brain must temporarily reorganize to respond correctly. Think of it as multi-tasking. It's harder to do two different things at once compared to focusing on only a single thing.

        This <strong> "switching" </strong> ability is thought to be a critical executive function that allows us to pay attention and deal with multiple things at once -- to multitask. The fact that we have switch costs when doing more than one thing at a time is one reason why driving and doing other activities (such as texting) can be dangerous.

        <h2>Why do we measure executive functions?</h2>
        Executive functions help us all navigate the complex world we live in. They help us multi-task, plan for the future, stay on task, complete goals, and remembering to remember ("I need to remember to go to the grocery store after work"). Executive functions are related to many health outcomes and mental health outcomes, such as decline in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's or Parkinsons.
