        <h2>What do my results mean?</h2>

        <p>
        We measured your ability to keep distinct items in mind from relevant categories. This is thought to depend to two distinct abilities: <br><br>

        <strong>General executive function: </strong> This skill relates to your ability to stay focused on the test despite all of the distractions around you, or even the distractions from your own thoughts. In this test, your general executive function helped you keep specific words in mind in the face of all the distracting, irrelevant words from other categories. <br>

        <strong>Updating: </strong> This skill is thought to reflect how accurately you can remove and replace items in working memory. This is important! As you go through your daily life you're constantly updating your working memory. You're pushing out of your mind anything irrelevant that just happened, and keeping in your mind all the relevant stuff that is now happening. It's even happening as you read this paragraph! In this test, for example, if you were asked to keep track of animals and saw the word "Cat" followed by "Cow", you need to forget about the now irrelevant "Cat" and remember the word "Cow" to answer correctly.<br>

        Your performance depends on many factors. These include the two mental abilities described described above, but also things like how awake you were (or how much coffee you've had!), how motivated you were to perform well or how distracting your environment was.

        <h2>Why do we measure executive functions?</h2>
        Executive functions help us all navigate the complex world we live in. They help us multi-task, plan for the future, stay on task, complete goals, and remembering to remember ("I need to remember to go to the grocery store after work"). As you can imagine, executive functions are related to many health outcomes and mental health outcomes, such as decline in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's or Parkinsons.
