        <h1>Your results!</h1>

        <p>
        You remembered <srong> {{ average_correct }}% </strong> of all relevant words correctly. Thanks for the hard work!

        You performed better on this test than {{ perc_better }}% of other Genes for Good participants in your age range. As more people take this test your results may change, so feel free to look at your results again.

        <h2>What do my results mean?</h2>

        <p>
        We measured your ability to keep distinct items in mind from relevant categories, 
        while ignoring those from irrelevant categories. This is thought to depend to two distinct abilities: <br><br>

        <strong>General executive function</strong> relates to your ability to stay focused on the test despite all of the distactions around you, or even the distractions from your own thoughts.
        General executive function also helps you maintain specific words in mind, in the face of distacting, irrelevant words from other categories. <br><br>

        <strong>Updating</strong> is thought to reflect how accurately you can remove and replace items in working memory.
        For example, if you were asked to keep track of animals and saw the word "Cat" followed by "Cow", you need to forget about the now irrelevant "Cat" and remember the word "Cow" to answer correctly.

        Your performance depends on many factors. These include the two mental abilities described described above, but also things like how awake you were (or how much coffee you've had!), how motivated you were to perform well, how distracting your environment was, and even possibly the computer keyboard and monitor you used.  

        <h2>Why do we measure executive functions?</h2>
        Executive functions help us all navigate the complex world we live in. They help us multi-task, plan for the future, stay on task, complete goals, and remembering to remember ("I need to remember to go to the grocery store after work"). As you can imagine, executive functions are related to many health outcomes and mental health outcomes, such as decline in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's or Parkinsons.
